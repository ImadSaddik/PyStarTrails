# PyStarTrails

![Thumbnail](./images/thumbnail.jpg)

This repository allows you to create star trails images and timelapse videos using Python. The project uses [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for image stacking and [imageio](https://github.com/imageio/imageio) for timelapse generation. Currently, you can run the provided Python scripts manually. In the future, I plan to add a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make the process even easier.
